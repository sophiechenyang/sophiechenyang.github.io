# Computational Neuroscience
Computation neuroscience provides tools and methods for:
1. characterizing [what](https://github.com/sophiechenyang/sophiechenyang.github.io/blob/main/neuroscience.md#descriptive-model-of-cortical-receptive-fields) nervous systems do
1. determining [how](https://github.com/sophiechenyang/sophiechenyang.github.io/blob/main/neuroscience.md#mechanistic-model-of) they function
1. [why](http://google.com) they operate in participular ways 
(P.Dayan and L. Abbott)

Receptive field comprises of specific properties of a sensory stimulus that elicts a very robust or strong response from the cell. Examples may include spot of light that turns on at a _particular location_ on the retina, or bar of light that turns on at a _particular orientation_ and _location_ on the retina.

#### Descriptive model of Receptive Fields 
When a person looks at an object, the inverted image is projected onto the back of the eye on the retina. The layer of tissues called the retinall ganglion cells convey information about the image to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which in turn passes the information to the primary visual cortex in the back of the brain. You can find the receptive fields in the retina by flashing a spot of light on different locations of the retina. 

**Center-Surround Receptive Fields in the Retina**

An on-center, off-surround cell becomes more active when only the center of this area is illuminated and less active when the only edges of this area (the surround) are illuminated. Conversely, cells with an off-center, on-surround receptive field respond with increased activities when light is turned off in the center region and on in the surrounding region.

In the visual cortext, we can find cells that respond best to different orientation and center-surround receptive fields
