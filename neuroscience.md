### On-Center, Off-Surround, Receptive Field
Receptive field comprises of specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generates a very robust or a strong response from any cell that you're recording from. An on-center, off-surround cell becomes more active when only the center of this area is illuminated and less active when the only edges of this area (the surround) are illuminated.
